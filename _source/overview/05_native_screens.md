# Native Screens

There are times where neither web-based content nor [bridge components](/overview/bridge-components) are enough. Times where you need maximum fidelity or interaction with native SDKs and APIs. For these, you can build fully native screens in Kotlin and Swift.

There are a few things to note:

- It's strongly encouraged that these native screens have a URL identifier, so it's easier to integrate them into Hotwire Native's navigation.
- Purely native screens will likely take specialized experience from iOS and Android developers.
- You'll need to write a version for every platform and go through the app store review process for any future changes

Leveraging Hotwire Native allows you to build full products with smaller development teams. You can focus on high fidelity native development where it matters most and leverage your existing web app for everything else.

Check out the [iOS](/ios/native-screens)- and [Android](/android/native-screens)-specific pages for information and code snippets.
