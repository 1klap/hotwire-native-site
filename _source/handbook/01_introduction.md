# Introduction

Hotwire Native makes your mobile web content feel at home on Android and iOS by using standard, platform-specific components and animations. To all but the most tech-savvy users, it will feel like a fully native app.

Under the hood, it’s a glorified web browser. Hotwire Native renders whatever HTML and CSS your server spits out. Here's an example from the Basecamp iOS app. Only the green content is native, everything else is from the web.

Adding new screens is as straightforward as building new pages in your web app. Your Android and iOS clients will see updates as soon as you deploy. All without new submissions to the app stores.

And upgrading to native isn’t an all-or-nothing decision. You are free to choose specific screens or even specific *components* to migrate when you’re ready. It truly is progressive enhancement.

Get started by following the [Android](#) or [iOS](#) guides.
