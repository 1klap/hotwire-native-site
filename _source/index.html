    Building completely native mobile apps is often time-consuming, requires large teams, and every update needs to wind its way through the app store review process. <b>Hotwire Native</b> provides an answer to all of these drawbacks with its web-first approach.</b>
  </p>

  <p>
    Hotwire Native enables you to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and reuse them across all your mobile platforms. If you already have a <a href="https://hotwired.dev">Hotwire</a> web app, you can use the screens you've already built!
  </p>

  <p>
    It unlocks bug fixes and new features without having to go through app store review. And full access to underlying Android and iOS SDKs and APIs as soon as they are released.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hotwire Native means small teams can build highly functional, beautiful, and sustainable mobile apps. All without the headache and rigmarole of traditional native development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hotwire Native wraps a web view within a native shell to render HTML from your server. It pairs this with native navigation and transition animations between screens. And for times when the web's not enough, you can upgrade to fully native screens and components.
