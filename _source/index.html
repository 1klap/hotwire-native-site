    Using <b>Hotwire Native</b> means building your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and reusing them across all your mobile platforms.
  </p>

  <p>
    It unlocks bug fixes and new features without having to go through app store review. And full access to underlying Android and iOS SDKs and APIs as soon as they are released.
  </p>

  <p>
    Hotwire Native means small teams can build highly functional, beautiful, and sustainable mobile apps. All without the headache and rigmarole of traditional native development.
  </p>

  <p>
    It's all done by wrapping a web view and rendering HTML. And for those instances when the web's not enough, you can upgrade to native screens and components with <a href="https://strada.hotwired.dev">Strada</a>.
